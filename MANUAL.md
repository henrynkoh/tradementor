## Advanced Topics

### Understanding the 3-Step Approach

TradeMentor is built around Ross Cameron's 3-step trading approach:

1. **Simplify Indicators**: Focus on a few powerful indicators (VWAP, 8/20-day SMA, volume)
2. **Identify Patterns**: Learn to recognize key candlestick patterns
3. **Confirm Signals**: Use multiple indicators together for higher probability trades

### Implementing the Strategy

To apply this approach in real trading:

1. Look for a clear candlestick pattern (e.g., hammer)
2. Check if price is above VWAP (for bullish trades) or below VWAP (for bearish trades)
3. Confirm with volume and moving averages (high volume, 8-day SMA crossing 20-day SMA)
4. Only take trades that show confirmation from multiple indicators

### Risk Management

Remember to always implement proper risk management:

- Never risk more than 1-2% of your account on a single trade
- Use stop losses based on the identified pattern (e.g., below the low of a hammer pattern)
- Consider taking partial profits at predetermined levels
- Always have an exit strategy before entering a trade
