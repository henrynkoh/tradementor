## Core Concepts

### Candlestick Analysis
Candlestick charts show price movement over time with "candles" that display open, high, low, and close prices.

### Technical Indicators
- **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)**: Helps identify trend direction and potential support/resistance.
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: Shows the average price over a specific period, helping to identify trends.
- **Volume**: Confirms the strength of price movements.

### Pattern Recognition
TradeMentor automatically detects common candlestick patterns:
- Hammer (bullish reversal)
- Shooting Star (bearish reversal)
- Doji (indecision)
- Engulfing patterns

## 3-Step Trading Approach

TradeMentor teaches Ross Cameron's 3-step approach:

1. **Simplify Indicators**: Focus on a few powerful indicators (VWAP, 8/20-day SMA, volume).
2. **Identify Patterns**: Learn to spot key candlestick patterns.
3. **Confirm Signals**: Use multiple indicators together for higher probability trades.

## Next Steps

1. Complete all training modules
2. Practice identifying patterns on different timeframes
3. Experiment with different stocks and indicators
4. Apply the 3-step approach to real-world trading scenarios
